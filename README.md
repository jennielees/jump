Jump
============

Jump is a Chrome extension made purely for myself because I missed having a link shortener around.

Rather than roll a remote shortener, I decided to write a little extension which uses Chrome sync to store a bunch of key: url pairs. Hit the arrow button to add a new link, or go to the page listing all links. Use `ju` as your omnibox shortcut to glory.

Yes, for frequently visited sites this isn't much of an improvement over just typing the first few letters of the site into the omnibox. Where I find this kind of shortcut really handy, though, is for URLs like "New Google Drive document" (or a specific doc), or deep-linking into analytics systems, dashboards, etc -- sites where there are a bunch of potential autocompletes and you can't really tell the difference at a glance.
